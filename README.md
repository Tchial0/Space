# [Space](http://www.tspace.ml)
- This is the source code of the **Space** website
- Small changes are made to the source code provided here in order to upload it to the webserver
- This source code is tested locally using **Xampp**

## Run it locally on your own machine
1. To run **Space** locally on your machine you will need to set up a **web server software** (I use **Apache HTTP Server**) and a **MySQL** or **MariaDB** server.
2. You will have to create the **Space**'s database using the dump found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Tchial0/Space/tree/main/mysql">here</a>
3. Once this source code is coming from my computer, it is supposed to appear some errors (easy to fix).
4. In order to avoid errors set the database user "root" with no password
